# Compare *23andMe* V3 and V5 results
Back in 2011 I had my genome analyzed using the V3 chip of *23andMe*, I recently retested my genome using *23andMe*'s V5 chip. The Jupyter notebook here runs a quick comparison of the two results to see where they are discordant and what potential effects this might have on predicting phenotypes.
